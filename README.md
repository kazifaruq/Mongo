Assuming youâ€™ve already installed Node.js and vscode
create a folder let us say mongo
then open it with vscode
then open terminal from vscode
and make sure you are in mongo folder
then type npm init and enter
This command prompts you for a number of things, such as the name and version of your application. 
For now, you can simply hit RETURN to accept the defaults for most of them

then type npm install express mongoose nodemon then enter
then type npm run dev and enter
